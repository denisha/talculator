<p>TAKEALOT provides staff with a super awesome benefit: potential discounts by reducing the markup! But only once a month. </p>

<h4>Exclusions</h4>
<li>Fashion category</li>
<li>Marketplace items</li>
<li>Vouchers including Gaming Department (XBox Gold / PSN / etc)</li>
<li>Airtime</li>
<li>Liquor</li>

<strong>Note:</strong> 
<p>Lots of products already have a low markup because TAKEALOT is awesome, you're not going to win here. </p>
<p>Not an exclusion but some of our items are imported and attract a higher staff price than the normal markup. eg Perfumes.</p>
<p>Sports items are the higher of 15% discount or staff price. staff_price=max(sales-15%, cost +VAT+5%</p>
<strong>Step 1 - Sign up!</strong>
Sign up for an account on takealot.com (duh!) using your staff email. 
<strong>Step 2 - Email stafforders@takealot.com and ask that your takealot.com account be set up as a Staff Profile. </strong>
<strong>Step 3 - Order some stuff!</strong>
Shop! Add things to your cart, and check out. 
Shipping: Choose Collect
Payment: Choose EFT
Confirm
You'll get an email Order Placed - Awaiting Payment
Step 4 - Wait for staff pricing 
Wait until ~23:00 that evening, where a batch process runs, and updates your order with a possible lower price. If you've made alot of orders that day, only the one with the highest saving wins [ref?]. 
Step 5 - Pay or cancel
(smile) Happy! Visit the order, update the payment type (ideally InstantEFT/PayFast), and complete payment. Try do this as early as possible in the morning, before 09:30. 
(sad) Sad... Cancel the order. Visit Step 3 again. This won't affect your "once a month" staff pricing benefit. 
Note:
If the EFT is not confirmed within 30 minutes, email shanaaz.cassiem@takealot.com in Finance to chase it up with PayFast. 
For payment type COD (rather just don't), then you MUST be available to collect and MUST have the cash to pay for the order as it arrives. If you're busy, ensure someone else is prepared with cash to collect it for you. This order cannot fail on delivery. * Note: COD is not available for collect orders, only orders fulfilled by a MrD courier where the value is less than R5K and we have not flagged you as dodgy fraudster (chrisb)
Step 6 - Arrange milk run delivery
Wait for the Order Ready For Collection email.
Forward it onto collect.orders@takealot.com (same mailbox as collect@takealot.com and collects@takealot.com) and ask that the order is included on the next milk run to TAKEALOT Auto Atlantic Building. Try do this before 11:30 to get it on the same day. You'll get a confirmation saying when you can expect the order to arrive. 
It's good practice to list your order numbers and for whom the order is, e.g.: "Please send the following orders to TAKEALOT Auto Atlantic Building: #123456 and #123457, for attention Digger Dan."
Step 7 - Collect!
You'll get an email saying Order Collected when the order has been fetched at the warehouse for the milk run... Then in an hour or two... You'll be emailed when your stuff is ready to pick up at the front desk (smile) Enjoy!
Front desk is not responsible for the safe keeping of your orders. If you have any high value items being ordered then please ensure you collect same day.
Now, back to work! (smile)
